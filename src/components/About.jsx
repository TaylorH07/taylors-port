              -- I graduated from SMUâ€™s Full Stack Web Development Program while
              working as a full time special education inclusion teacher and
              coaching multiple sports. As someone who comes from a strong
              educational background, hardwork and the drive to learn never
              ends. From being a collegiate football team captain and a member
              of the team's leadership committee to becoming a middle school
              teacher and coach, leadership has always come naturally to me. I
              bring a strong work ethic, unparalleled patience, and the ability
              to complete tasks in an unconventional environment. My attention
              to detail, creativity and teamwork are my greatest strengths. I am
              eager to apply my skills and become a part of your software
              engineering team!
