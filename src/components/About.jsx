              -- I graduated from SMUâ€™s Full Stack Web Development Program while
              teaching students with learning disabilities, and coaching track
              and football. As someone who comes from a strong educational background, hardwork and the drive to learn never ends. From being a collegiate football team captain and a  member of the team's leadership committee to being an educator in charge of team building activities; leadership has always come naturally to me. I bring a strong work ethic, unparalleled patience, and the ability to complete tasks in unconventional environment. With a keen eye for detail,
               and my strengths in creativity and teamwork, I am eager to apply my knowledge to become your next Software Engineer.
